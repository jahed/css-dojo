## What to do

### Session #1

*Layout & Box Model*

The structure of the project is straight forward. Under `./sources` you'll find all of your assets.

The aim of this session is to style `index.html` as explained with minimal markup changes.

> #### Optional:
> Since the build uses Middleman you can use ERB or HAML templates for generating HTML and SASS for your CSS. To keep
> things simple, I've left everything as plain old HTML and CSS.

### Session #2
